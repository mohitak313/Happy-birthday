"I know about you and Smith. I also know that you both are in a relationship.
          Honestly, I have no problem with it. If you had told me about it earlier, it would have been better.
You never told me anything about that, and I only found it out a few days ago.
 You could have shared it with me earlier, but anyways, itâ€™s fine. Tumne to phele hi mujhe mna kar diya tha me hi 
 bewakoof hu jo kuch bhi sochta rha. Mujhe tbhi hi smjh jana chaiye kuch aissa bhi ho skta h.
 <br>
It's my fault, I'm sorry. Now, Iâ€™m leaving...<br><br>
Or vaise bhi meri vaje se tumhare ghar vale tum se acche baat bhi nhi krte h.
 Honestly, itâ€™s better that we donâ€™t talk anymore.
 Tumhe daat pdhti h or sb rudely baat karte h. 
 Meri vajhe se kisi ke sath aissa ho me nhi chata hu. <br>
It took me 17 days to build this website only for you. <br>
I have a gift for you â€“ there are 2 buttons[dekho].<br> It took a lot of time to make, so please check it out carefully (hehehe)...<br><br>

Take care ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’”"
